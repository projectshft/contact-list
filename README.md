# Contact List

Hey! This is a contact list app that I built using React and React Router.

## Run locally

To run locally, fork and clone this repository.

In the directory you want to install this app in, run the following commands in your bash terminal:

```
git clone [repo link here]
cd contact-list
npm install
npm start
```

That's it! Now you should be able to use the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Features

To get started, click "New" to create a new contact.

Fill out as much (or as little) information about your contact as you would like. If you leave your contact blank, they will show up as No Name in your contacts sidebar.

To edit a contact once you've created it, click "Edit" and change whichever fields you would like.

Once you have a number of contacts created, you might want to search for one in your contacts search bar. This will sort through your contacts and display any that match your search term.

If you find yourself on a page that doesn't exist, you will run into a 404 error page and be redirected back here.

⚠ Note: Right now, this app does not utilize local storage, so if you reload the browser, your contacts will be lost.
