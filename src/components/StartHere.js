        ðŸ˜€ Hey! This is a contact list app that I built using React and React
        Router.
      </p>
      <h2>âš™ Features</h2>
      <p>To get started, click "New" to create a new contact. </p>
      <p>
        Fill out as much (or as little) information about your contact as you
        would like. If you leave your contact blank, they will show up as{' '}
        <i>No Name</i> in your contacts sidebar.
      </p>
      <p>
        To edit a contact once you've created it, click "Edit" and change
        whichever fields you would like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a number of contacts created, you might want to search for
        one in your contacts search bar. This will sort through your contacts
        and display any that match your search term.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find yourself on a page that doesn't exist, you will run into a
        404 error page and be redirected back here.
      </p>
      <p>
        âš  Note: Right now, this app does not utilize local storage, so if you
        reload the browser, your contacts will be lost.
      </p>
    </>
